                  The word cloud behind represents elements of the journey I and the team have been on. I can talk for hours about any one of these elements. Sadly, we do not have that time.</br>
                  I lead a Web Operations team. Fundamentally this is a cost centre. 20m from now I want you to leave here thinking about trust within your enterprise and the effect it has on value for cost and profit centers</br>
                  I will show you how trust fits directly into your value chain.

              <aside class="notes">
                Interconnections in systems operate through the flow of information </br> 
                People share information through communication  </br> 
                Communication quality is governed by trust and thus the efficiency and effectiveness of the info flow depends on trust. </br>
                distrust will be the number 1 cause of friction for information flow in any enterprise. When info doesn't flow... time is wasted </br>

                by trusting this person </br>
                by doubling down on communicating information about the transformation of the team </br>
                I was able to recruit this person back into the web operations team where he's been an amazing teammate and wonderful engineer </br>
                Here's the value: I was able to retain a top talent thus saving recruiting costs. </br>
                I was able to keep 8 years of knowledge and experience part of the team priceless</br>
                I must emphasize this was only possible with stellar communication of information and trust with this person. This is ever more important for teams </br>

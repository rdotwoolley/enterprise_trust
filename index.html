					<h2>Why Should You Trust me?</h2>
					<p class="fragment" align="left">I've broken and fixed many systems over the past decade</p>
					<p class="fragment" align="left">In several industries</p>
					<p class="fragment" align="left">I'm a bit crazy</p>

					<aside class="notes">
					  I have been a systems engineer for 10 years and a leader of teams for 5. </br>
					  I have worked in transportation and telecom, pipelines and scada, medical imaging and now financial services. </br>

						The word cloud behind represents elements of the journey I and the team have been on. I can talk for hours about any one of these elements. Sadly, we do not have that time.</br>
						I lead a Web Operations team. Fundamentally this is a cost centre. 20m from now I want you to leave here thinking about trust within your enterprise and the effect it has on value for cost and profit centers</br>
						I will show you how trust fits directly into your value chain.

              Make sure to mention that you will use the terms business, company and enterprise interchangeable </br>
              The Year is 2012 and I am well into my belief that business are a system. </br>
              As a constant student the research and learning begins.</br>

              Donealla Meadows is the matriarch of systems theory. </br> 
              The book thinking in systems is required reading for any of us trying to grasp the complex nature of our companies.  </br>

                The Lean Enterprise authors take it even further in refinement </br>

                &ldquo;Your enterprise is a complex adaptive system that is composed of people who share a common purpose. The people are interconnected by the flow of information which is facilitated by communication and galvanized by trust.&rdquo;
              </blockquote>          
              <aside class="notes">
                Interconnections in systems operate through the flow of information </br> 
                People share information through communication  </br> 
                Communication quality is governed by trust and thus the efficiency and effectiveness of the info flow depends on trust. </br>
                distrust will be the number 1 cause of friction for information flow in any enterprise. When info doesn't flow... time is wasted </br>

                Prior to joining the team, the Web Operations team was governed by BYOB</br> 
                It was a tough gig. It had chewed through a few people.  </br> 
                Including one of the most talented and caring systems engineers I have ever had the pleasure of working with. </br>
                The former leader of this team </br>
                with a great deal of effort to restore trust...</br>
                by listening </br>
                by always meeting my commitments to this person </br>
                by trusting this person </br>
                by doubling down on communicating information about the transformation of the team </br>
                I was able to recruit this person back into the web operations team where he's been an amazing teammate and wonderful engineer </br>
                Here's the value: I was able to retain a top talent thus saving recruiting costs. </br>
                I was able to keep 8 years of knowledge and experience part of the team priceless</br>
                I must emphasize this was only possible with stellar communication of information and trust with this person. This is ever more important for teams </br>
